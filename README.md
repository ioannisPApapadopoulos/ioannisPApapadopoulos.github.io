# John Doe

Welcome to my GitHub io page! I'm John Doe, a numerical analyst with expertise in numerical optimization and numerical linear algebra. On this page, you'll find information about my research interests, projects, and other resources related to numerical analysis.

## About Me

I received my PhD in Mathematics from XYZ University in 20XX. Since then, I've been working as a postdoctoral researcher at ABC University, where I focus on developing numerical methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

- Nonlinear optimization
- Numerical linear algebra
- Parallel computing
- Scientific computing

## Projects

Here are some of the numerical analysis projects I've worked on:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/username/project1): A Python library for solving nonlinear optimization problems using gradient-based methods.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/username/project2): An implementation of the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for computing eigenvalues of large sparse matrices.

## Resources

Here are some resources related to numerical analysis that I've found helpful:

- [Book 1](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Optimization-Edwin-Chong/dp/1108402186): An introduction to optimization theory and methods.
- [Course 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matrix-methods-machine-learning): A Coursera course on matrix methods for machine learning.
- [Article 1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2155633): An article on preconditioning techniques for solving linear systems.
