I am a [BMS Dirichlet fellow](https://www.math-berlin.de/bms-faculty/dirichlet-postdoctoral-program) (postdoc) in the
[Nonsmooth Variational Problems and Operator Equations](https://www.wias-berlin.de/research/rgs/fg8/index.jsp?lang=1) group at the [Weierstrass Institute in Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/).

I work on the numerical
solution of partial differential equations, with a particular focus on

 - high-order spectral/hp-finite element methods,
 - topology optimization,
 - quasivariational inequalities,
 - computing multiple solutions of nonlinear PDEs.

I have applied the numerical techniques I develop to various
applications, in the areas of fractional PDEs and topology optimization.

I lead the development of
[fir3dab](https://github.com/ioannisPApapadopoulos/fir3dab), and regularly
commit to Julia packages in
[JuliaApproximation](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation).

I have collected a number of self-contained codes in MATLAB, Python, and Julia of deflation techniques for computing multiple solutions of nonlinear discretized PDEs/systems in a [Github repository](https://github.com/ioannisPApapadopoulos/Deflation).
