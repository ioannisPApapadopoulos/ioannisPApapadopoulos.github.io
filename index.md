I am a [Research Associate](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/patrick.farrell) in the
Numerical Analysis group at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/ioannis.papadopoulos13">Imperial College London</a>.

I work on the numerical
solution of partial differential equations, with a particular focus on

 - finite element methods,
 - high-order spectral element methods,
 - topology optimization,
 - computing multiple solutions of nonlinear PDEs.

I have applied the numerical techniques I develop to various
applications, in the areas of fractional PDEs and topology optimization.

I lead the development of
[fir3dab](https://github.com/ioannisPApapadopoulos/fir3dab), and regularly
commit to Julia packages in
[JuliaApproximation](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation).
